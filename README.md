Data Science Portfolio Project #07
Project - Medical Cost Prediction
Models Used - Linear & Polynomial Regression and Decision Tree & Random Forest Regressor
About the Project:
This project aims to estimate the medical treatment expenses of patients by considering their attributes, including age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, number of children, and region. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), it was discovered that smoking habits exhibited a significant correlation with treatment costs, which were observed to rise with increased smoking habits, age, and BMI. Employing the Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressor models yielded remarkable results, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 82%.
